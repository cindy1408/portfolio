        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p> Graduated in Mechanical Engineering, then followed 3 years teaching Mathematics in Secondary Education. <br> 
       My passion is in learning, hence going into teaching, however, I have learnt that teaching is very similar to reciting what you already know and to some extent, the learning curve will flatten.
    Technology has always fasinated me, from displaying information on monitors to artifical intelligence. It is a field that is consistenly growing and will never stop.
 I know it is a field I can never stop learning new concepts, new programs and new technology.</p>
